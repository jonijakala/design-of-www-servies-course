Internet resume service

## General

We regret that the service is not yet fully operational. The features in the CV pages are implemented and functional, but we are missing many features we wanted to implement. However, the basics of the service are operational.

### Demo User

You could try our demo user to see some ready content for the profile page. The auth is demo@aalto.fi, password: 'demo'

### Instructions

#### Prerequisities

- Install npm (tested 2.14.7)
- Install node (tested 4.2.1)
- Install bower
- Install gulp (`npm install gulp -g`)

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Run server
Navigate to project root via commandline. Then:

```
gulp
```

Now if terminal shows no errors you'll have server up and running. You can open `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.
